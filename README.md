# Design Patterns

Design patterns written in C#

## Definition

A software design pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. 
Design patterns are formalized best practices that the programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system.

In my opinion, this defines very well what a design pattern is.

## Advantages of using them

- Promote easier changes
- Turns the objects reusable
- Keeps objects small and specialized

## Types

- Creational patterns
- Structural patterns
- Behavioral patterns
- Concurrency patterns

# Setup

## Clone repository

Create and go to the directory where you want to place the repository

```bash
  cd my-directory
```

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/pncsoares/dotnet-design-patterns.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd dotnet-design-patterns
```

## Run the Console Applications

Open terminal and execute the command

```bash
  dotnet run --project projectPath/projectName.csproj
  
  # example
  # dotnet run --project ./BuilderPattern/BuilderPattern.WithoutPattern/BuilderPattern.WithoutPattern.csproj
```
