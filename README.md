# Design Patterns

Design patterns written in C#

## Definition

A software design pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. 
Design patterns are formalized best practices that the programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system.

In my opinion, this defines very well what a design pattern is.

## Advantages of using them

- Promote easier changes
- Turns the objects reusable
- Keeps objects small and specialized

## Types

- Creational patterns
- Structural patterns
- Behavioral patterns
- Concurrency patterns

### Creational patterns

Deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. The basic form of object creation could result in design problems or in added complexity to the design. Creational design patterns solve this problem by somehow controlling this object creation.

Are composed of two dominant ideas:
1. Encapsulating knowledge about which concrete classes the system uses;
1. Hiding how instances of these concrete classes are created and combined.

### Structural patterns

Ease the design by identifying a simple way to realize relationships among entities. 

### Behavioral patterns

Identify common communication patterns among objects. By doing so, these patterns increase flexibility in carrying out communication. 

### Concurrency patterns

Deal with the multi-threaded programming paradigm.

# Setup

## Clone repository

Create and go to the directory where you want to place the repository

```bash
  cd my-directory
```

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/pncsoares/dotnet-design-patterns.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd dotnet-design-patterns
```

## Run the Console Applications

Open terminal and execute the command

```bash
  dotnet run --project projectPath/projectName.csproj
  
  # example
  # dotnet run --project ./BuilderPattern/BuilderPattern.WithoutPattern/BuilderPattern.WithoutPattern.csproj
```
